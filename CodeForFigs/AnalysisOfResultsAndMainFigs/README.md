This directory contains code to analyse and plot the figures presented in the main text of the manuscript. 

Figs 2-5 can be generated by executing the files prefixed with A2-A5. For ex. **A2_Fig2DataAnalysis.m** will perform all data analyses for Fig. 2 
in the main text and generate the corresponding fig. Note that I have chosen to number these A2-A5 to refer to the fig numbers in the main text.

In addition, in generating Fig 5 (.m file prefixed with A5), the script will also generate the supplementary figure S22.

<ins>All observational data presented in the manuscript are present in the directory **ObsData** in the master repo. This is relevant to Figs. 3, 4, and 5 in the main text. Please make sure to edit the relevant path to the files in the **ObsData** directory accordingly</ins>

More details can be found in the relevant .m files.
