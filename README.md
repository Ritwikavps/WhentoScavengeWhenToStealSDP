# WhentoScavengeWhenToStealSDP
This repository contains code written by RVPS for the simulations, data analysis and figures presented in the manuscript 'When to Scavenge and When To Stea' by Ritwika VPS (UC Merced, UCLA), Ajay Gopinathan (UC Merced), and Justin Yeakel (UC Merced). 

The directory **SDPCode** contains the main simulation code; **CodeForFigs** contains the code written to analyse simulation resuls and generate figs in the main text (in the directory *AnalysisOfResultsAndMainFigs), as well as figs in the supplementary material (in the directory *SuppInfoFigs*); and **SensitivityAnalyses** contains code used to run sensitivity analyses and plot the results of these analyses, as reported in the supplementary material.

All code was written in MATLAB, and each directory contains its won README with relevant details.
